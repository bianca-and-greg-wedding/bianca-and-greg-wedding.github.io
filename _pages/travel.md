## Venue

The wedding itself will take place at The Estate at Moraine Farm, a venue about half an hour north of Boston in Beverly, MA.  Our Friday welcome dinner and Sunday morning farewell brunch will take place in the Boston/Cambridge area, all accessible by public transit (details TBD).

## Shuttle

If you marked on your RSVP that you'd be taking the shuttle, then there is space reserved for you on the shuttle.  If you did not indicate that you'd be taking the shuttle, please let us know ASAP.  There are limited extra seats available.  If you said you'd be taking the shuttle but changed your mind, please also let us know in case anyone else wants a seat.

The shuttle will pick up at 3:15PM outside the Boston Marriott at the car turnaround on Broadway (NOT on Main St).  Please arrive early to make sure you don't miss the shuttle!

The shuttle will return to the hotel ~10:45PM.


## Hotels
We have a hotel block at the Boston Marriott Cambridge (50 Broadway, Cambridge MA, 02142) in Kendall Square of Cambridge, MA (but the deadline to book via the room block has passed).  If you'd like, you still can book them directly on your own.

Down the block is The Kendall Hotel (approx $270/night), a cute smaller hotel.  They didn't have room blocks available but may be a good option as well!

The Kendall Square hotels are in the main Boston/Cambridge metro area about half an hour from the main wedding venue.  We will be providing a shuttle bus from the Marriott Hotel to and from the wedding on Saturday.  The Boston area also has plenty of Airbnbs and other hotels -- Kendall Square has a T station, so you can get there from anywhere in the Boston/Cambridge area to take the shuttle bus to and from the venue.


If you'd rather stay closer to the venue, that works too!  There is a lot less public transit out in the suburbs, so if you go this route, you may need to rent a car.  Lyfts and Ubers should be available but probably have slower pickup times than in the city.

A few options near each other and about 15m from the venue and 30-45 minutes from Boston and the airport:
* Homewood Suites by Hilton Boston-Peabody (estimated $169/night)
* Hampton Inn Boston/Peabody (estimated $150/night)
* SpringHill Suites by Marriott Boston Peabody (estimated $182/night)


## Transit within Boston

The subway system within Boston and Cambridge is called the T.  It is mostly underground but also has some above ground sections.  A one way ticket on the subway is $2.40.  You can pay cash for a single ticket at a station or put money on a CharlieCard if you'll be making multiple trips.  There's also a large bus network.  Bus tickets are $1.70 one way and can also be paid for in cash or with a CharlieCard.  The subway is generally reliable and comes ~every 5 minutes during commuting hours.  It comes less frequently (~every 20m) on weekends and nights.  You can view more information on [the MBTA website](mbta.com/schedules/subway) -- schedules are changing frequently due to the pandemic.

The Marriott Hotel is on the same block as the Kendall/MIT T stop.  The Kendall/MIT T stop is on the Red Line.  The Kendall/MIT T station has an elevator, as does South Station.

Right now, there's some construction on the Red Line and sometimes the subway is replaced with a shuttle bus between the same subway stations.  If that happens, there'll be clear signage, but you should check the MBTA website for the latest updates.


## Airport
The closest airport is Logan Airport (BOS).  Right now, there are direct flights to Boston from Toronto, Montreal, San Francisco, San Jose, and Seattle.  It doesn't seem that there are direct flights from Ottawa at the moment, but we hope that as the border reopens and travel ramps up that those will come back.

After you land in Boston, you can get on the T for free (only at the airport).  You'll get on the Silver Line (SL1) and take it to South Station.  At South Station, you will be able to transfer to the Red Line (headed towards Alewife) to get to Kendall/MIT.  You can also take the T back to the airport, but that will cost a normal fare.  It generally takes a little over half an hour to get from the airport to the Kendall/MIT T stop.

Boston also has plenty of Lyft and Uber availability in addition to traditional taxis.  At peak times, there can be a bit of a wait at the airport, though.
