Bianca grew up in Massachusetts. As a child she loved books, baking, math, robots, and the groundbreaking 1996 edutainment game [*Logical Journey of the Zoombinis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Journey_of_the_Zoombinis). In high school, she attended the Canada/USA Mathcamp, where she met Valya. After high school, she went off to MIT to study math and robots, where she met Shanté and Mark. After graduating, she moved out to the Bay Area to work on robots and hang out with Valya, Valya's friend Erica, and Shanté and Mark.

Greg grew up in California. As a child he loved books, baking, math, singing, and the watershed Broderbund educational puzzle video game [*Logical Journey of the Zoombinis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Journey_of_the_Zoombinis). In high school, he took a computer science class and discovered that it was easier to debug programs than the physical world, so he decided to study CS instead of biology. After high school, he went off to Princeton, where he met Valya and Erica. After graduating, he returned to the Bay Area to work as a software engineer and hang out with Valya and Erica.

Their paths first crossed at one of Erica's parties in 2016. Greg was immediately intrigued by the girl with blue hair who liked robots. Bianca... is pretty sure she remembers that Greg was at that party.

After running into each other again at various escape rooms and parties, Greg decided that it was time to express his interest in Bianca. Guessing that she shared his childhood loves of Zoombinis and baking, Greg decided that a Zoombinis + biscotti party was the ideal way to catch her attention (he also invited Valya, Erica, Shanté, and Mark to increase the odds that she would show up). The plan worked - Greg not only got a chance to talk with Bianca about their shared nostalgia for 1990's children's learning software, but he also scored a last minute invite to a ski trip that Mark was organizing. Over the course of a long ride home from Tahoe, their mutual interest became even clearer. Two weeks later, they went on their first date (which of course involved baking cookies), and the rest is history.
