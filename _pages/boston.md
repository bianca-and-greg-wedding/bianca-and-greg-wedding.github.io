## Locations!

The main metropolitan area of Boston and Cambridge are joined by a solid subway system and are generally pretty interchangeable.  Some of the locations on this list are in Cambridge, some are across the river in Boston.  It's a pretty small area and pretty walkable / public-transit-able. There's plenty of things to do and see in the surrounding areas, but we've focused our list on the Boston/Cambridge metro area since that's where we expect most people will be staying.  The main hotel is technically in Cambridge (but the airport is in Boston).  

## What to eat

#### Flour Bakery and Cafe
This is a local bakery chain -- the closest one to Kendall Square is at 190 Massachusetts Ave in Cambridge.  This is the one Bianca would stop by on her way to class if she was running late and needed breakfast and is always our first stop after getting off a redeye for coffee and pastries.  There's also locations in Harvard Square and Beacon Hill if you go exploring.  Greg's favorite item is the currant oat spelt scone.  Bianca recommends the breakfast pizzas and cinnamon cream brioche.  

#### Tatte Bakery and Cafe
This is a local bakery a couple minute walk from Kendall Square.  Their pastries are a bit fancier than Flour's, but the primary draw here is their fantastic breakfast sandwich.

#### Toscanini's Ice Cream
A slightly longer walk from Kendall Square, Tosci's is a Boston favorite!  Bianca's favorite flavor is B^3 (brown sugar, brown butter, and brownies).  Greg likes Kulfi and Goat Cheese Brownie.

#### Cafe Luna
This brunch place is another favorite we'll always stop by on a trip to Boston.  Greg loves the veggie scramble; Bianca alternates between egg benedicts and the goat cheese omelette.  Their french toast and lemon ricotta pancakes are also top notch!  If you're going on the weekend for their famous brunch menu, make sure you make a reservation at least a week ahead of time if you don't want to wait in line forever.

#### Mike's Pastries
For a real Boston experience, you can't miss Mike's Pastries for all your Italian-American goodies.  While people generally go for the cannoli, Bianca recommends checking out the lobster tails and pignoli cookies.  If you go to the North End location, you might be tempted to avoid the long line by going down the street to Modern's Pastries instead.  Don't do it.  (If you want a shorter line, there's a small Mike's Pastries location in Harvard Square you can check out instead!)

#### LA Burdick Handmade Chocolates
For the best hot chocolate you'll ever have, you can't miss Burdick's.  We recommend getting a small or splitting with a friend -- this stuff is seriously rich and creamy.  In addition to the standard milk/dark hot chocolate, they also offer a single source hot chocolate of the month, which is always a treat.  Their chocolates and desserts are also delicious.

#### The Mad Monkfish
Formerly Thelonious Monkfish, this is one of Bianca's favorite sushi restaurants from undergrad.  If you're not allergic, try the cranberry crab rangoons and the sleeping beauty roll.  If you go at the right time, you can also listen to some live jazz.

#### Clover Food Lab
When Bianca started college, this was a food truck, but it's since expanded to several brick and mortar stores in the Boston/Cambridge area.  There's one in Kendall Square a few steps from the hotel and another in Harvard Square.  They serve really delicious vegan and vegetarian food -- Bianca loves the chickpea fritter sandwich.  

#### Sebastians Cafe & Catering
A Distributed Robotics Lab favorite, Sebastian's has quick and tasty sandwiches, salads, pasta, and more.  Bianca has eaten more of their savory crepes than she'd like to count.  This is right down the block from Kendall Square.

#### Legal Seafoods
A Boston classic.  Bianca's family went here a lot growing up; this is one of her mom's favorite restaurants.  Bianca always gets the clam chowder.  There's one right in Kendall Square and others throughout the area as well, including the airport!

#### Harpoon Brewery
If you want to try some local beer & delicious pretzels, check out Harpoon!  They have an indoor & outdoor taproom in the Seaport District.  They are 21+ unless kids are accompanied by their parents.  During covid, they've also started serving a broader food menu.




## What to see


#### Museum of Science
The Hombergs used to have a family membership here; Bianca has many fond memories.  Fun for adults and kids, don't miss the hall of electricity or the top floor of the Blue Wing with the interactive physics playground.


#### Boston Common
There's pretty gardens and lots of green space to walk around.  Don't miss the famous Make Way for Ducklings statues!  You can also find the Freedom Trail starting point here.  Bonus points if you find the bench we took the header selfie at!


#### Faneuil Hall
A Boston tourist attraction that's definitely worth stopping by.  This long building has dozens of food stalls in every cuisine you can think of.  There's seating in the center, but people also often take their food outside to sit and watch one of the numerous street performers in the area.  There's also plenty of shops here too.


#### New England Aquarium
If you want to see a million different types of penguins or pet a baby manta ray in the petting zoo tan, this is the aquarium for you!  If you're just walking by, you can get a glimpse of a couple seals near the entrance line in an outdoor tank.


#### Freedom Trail
If you want to replicate a Massachusetts middle school field trip (and enjoy some local history), you should take a walk along the Freedom Trail.  This brick striping in the road brings you by a lot of important buildings and memorials from the Revolutionary War, in addition to walking through a bustling section of Boston.

#### Newbury Street
If you're looking for shopping, this is the place!  There's plenty of stores here as well as the Prudential Center mall.  Stop by Eataly for imported goods & food or Restoration Hardware to feel fancy sitting on very expensive furniture.  There's also plenty of restaurants here, but we haven't tried out many of them.

#### Lawn on D
If you've been wondering where people keep taking those instagram pictures with the glowy swings, look no further, it's this place.  They also have lawn games and some food options.  Make sure to check online if you're walking from public transit; it can be a bit tricky to find if you go around the wrong way.
