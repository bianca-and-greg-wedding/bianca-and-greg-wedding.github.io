Hello, my name is Greg Owen!

I'm a software engineer who used to be a chocolate maker (and before that I was almost a synthetic biologist). I'm currently working at [Sigma](https://www.sigmacomputing.com). I also spent [several years](https://databricks.com/blog/2019/08/09/brickster-spotlight-meet-greg.html) working at [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com) (you can see some of the things I worked on [here](https://databricks.com/blog/author/greg-owen)).

This blog is a place for me to store some of the lessons I've learned so that I don't have to make similar mistakes twice. Many of the posts are born from frustration recollected in tranquility. Some of them are about cake.
