#### Shuttle Details

If you marked on your RSVP that you'd be taking the shuttle, then there is space reserved for you on the shuttle.  If you did not indicate that you'd be taking the shuttle, please let us know ASAP.  There are limited extra seats available.  If you said you'd be taking the shuttle but changed your mind, please also let us know in case anyone else wants a seat.

The shuttle will pick up at 3:15PM outside the Boston Marriott at the car turnaround on Broadway (NOT on Main St).  Please arrive early to make sure you don't miss the shuttle!

It will return to the hotel and drop off ~10:45PM.

#### What about COVID?

Given that COVID seems to be here to stay (and case counts will hopefully be a lot lower as we approach summer), we're planning to move forward with the wedding in as safe a way as possible.  We are requiring that all vaccine-eligible adults and children only attend if fully vaccinated (including boosters, if applicable) by the time of the wedding.  If any children are young enough to not be eligible by the time of the wedding, they are still welcome -- we hope to keep them safe by having everyone else be fully vaccinated!

In addition, as many events as possible will be outdoors.  For the wedding itself, the ceremony and cocktail hour will be outdoors; dinner will be under a tent.  If it rains, the cocktail hour will be indoors and the ceremony and dinner will be under the tent (but we'll leave the sides open to allow ventilation).

The welcome pizza party and farewell brunch are both hosted at a location that is partially outdoors/indoors.  You are certainly welcome to stay on the outdoor portion for the entire event (though you'll need to walk through the indoor section to get to the outdoor section).  

We are not going to require testing before the wedding, though we do certainly hope that you'll stay home or get a PCR test if you're feeling sick!


#### I have a dietary restriction!

We are working with our caterer to accommodate all dietary restrictions.  Please fill in any allergy/restriction info on your RSVP form (even if you think we already know).  It will be a nut- and shellfish-free wedding.


#### What's the venue like?

Cocktail hour and the ceremony will be outdoors; the reception will be under a tent with some adjacent outdoor space for mingling.  If necessary, there will be heating or fans in the tent.  In case of rain, we’ll shuffle locations around and everything will be covered.  While the cocktail hour and dinner/dancing will have hard floors, the ceremony will be on grass and the bathrooms are ~150ft away from the main reception area, across a mostly flat grassy area.  The entire venue is wheelchair-accessible.


#### Can I park at the venue?

Yes!  The Estate at Moraine Farm is about 30 minutes north of Boston.  There is plenty of free parking at the venue and there are signs to indicate where to park once you’re on the property.  Just put ‘The Estate at Moraine Farm’ or '719 Cabot St, Beverly, MA' into Google Maps.  If you don’t want to drive, we’ll be offering a shuttle bus from the Kendall Marriott Hotel.  Please let us know if you're interested in the shuttle in your RSVP form so we can ensure there is space for everyone interested.  We would like to request that everyone wear masks while on the shuttle.


#### How do I get to the welcome party / farewell brunch location?

Both the welcome party and farewell brunch are at 281 Concord Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02138.  It’s ~an 18m walk from the Porter Square T station (on the red line) or an 11m drive from the Boston Marriott Cambridge.  There’s free street parking in the area.  Note: the red line seems to be under construction right now and may be replaced with a shuttle bus.  It’s generally well signed, but when I’ve had to take that bus before, it picked up right outside the Boston Marriott Cambridge, on the Main Street side.  

#### Are kids invited?

Yes!  We will have kids’ meals of mac & cheese and chicken fingers available.  After dinner, we’ll have coloring books and board games on the opposite side of the tent from the dance floor for any kids (or adults!) who are not interested in dancing.  The venue also provides a few high chairs for kids -- let us know in your RSVP form if you'll need one.


#### What's the dress code?

The dress code for the wedding itself is semi-formal attire.  Since we've seen many conflicting descriptions on the internet about what exactly that is, what we mean by this is: suits, jumpsuits, cocktail dresses, and long dresses are all good!  (No one will be wearing a tux.)  The welcome dinner and farewell brunch are both totally casual.


#### What's this I hear about a recipe guestbook?

For our guestbook, we'd love to collect your favorite recipe in addition to your signature.  We'll have a three ring binder to collect them all -- please bring your recipe on a standard 8.5x11 piece of paper; we'll have plastic sleeves to make inserting them easy (no need to hole punch your recipe).


#### I hear you'll have a band!

Yes!  We're going to have a few musicians from a local dueling piano bar (with their pianos!).  They'll be taking song requests throughout the evening, so think of a few favorite songs you'd love to dance to!


#### What are you doing about your names?

We’ll both be keeping our names legally & for work!  But socially, please feel free to refer to us as the Oberg Family. 


#### I have another question!

Feel free to reach out to biancagregwedding@gmail.com with any other questions!  Or, you know, reach out however you normally would.
