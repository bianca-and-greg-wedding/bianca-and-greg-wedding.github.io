#### What about COVID?

We’re planning pretty far out, so we’re hoping that everyone in both the US and Canada will be able to be vaccinated, travel will be possible without quarantining, and that we’ll be able to safely celebrate together.  A few months ahead of time, we will take a look at how things are going and, if necessary, reschedule.


#### I have a dietary restriction!

We are working with our caterer to accommodate all dietary restrictions.  Please fill in any allergy/restriction info on your RSVP form (even if you think we already know).  It will be a nut- and shellfish-free wedding.


#### What's the venue like?

Cocktail hour and the ceremony will be outdoors; the reception will be under a tent with some adjacent outdoor space for mingling.  If necessary, there will be heating in the tent.  In case of rain, we’ll shuffle locations around and everything will be covered.  While the cocktail hour and dinner/dancing will have hard floors, the ceremony will be on grass and the bathrooms are ~150ft away from the main reception area, across a mostly flat grassy area.  The entire venue is wheelchair-accessible.


#### Can I park at the venue?

Yes!  The Estate at Moraine Farm is about 30m north of Boston.  There is plenty of free parking at the venue and there are signs to indicate where to park once you’re on the property.  Just put ‘The Estate at Moraine Farm’ or '719 Cabot St, Beverly, MA' into Google Maps.  If you don’t want to drive, we’ll be offering a shuttle bus from the hotel.


#### Are kids invited?

Yes!  We will have kids’ meals of mac & cheese and chicken fingers available.  After dinner, we’ll have coloring books and board games on the opposite side of the tent from the dance floor for any kids (or adults!) who are not interested in dancing.  The venue also provides a few high chairs for kids -- let us know in your RSVP form if you'll need one.


#### What's the dress code?

The dress code for the wedding itself is semi-formal/cocktail attire.  Since dress codes are pretty loosely defined, what we mean by this is: suits, jumpsuits, cocktail dresses, and long dresses are all good! The welcome dinner and farewell brunch are both totally casual.


#### What are you doing about your names?

We’ll both be keeping our names legally & for work!  But socially, please feel free to refer to us as the Oberg Family. :)
